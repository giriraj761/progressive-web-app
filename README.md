# PWA_project_6sem_2022
I have worked on service worker and fetch api in this project. I also have used lighthouse. It was all done under the mentorship of Mr. Ankur Agrawal. I acknowledge his contribution to our project.
You will get to know about following:
a. Progressive web applications and Service Worker
b. Fetch API
c. Manifest
d. Offline features of a progressive webpage
e. Lighthouse

To run the project please download it and extract first. Secondly, open the file using command prompt or vs code. Then, run the server using node server.js in the terminal.
Thank you
